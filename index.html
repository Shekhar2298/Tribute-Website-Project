            <p><span style="color: rgb(225, 168, 168); font-size: 25px;">Chandragupta Maurya</span> (350-295 BCE) was
                the first emperor of the Mauryan Empire in Ancient India.
                He expanded an extensive kingdom in Magadha and founded the Maurya dynasty.
                He reigned from 320 BCE to 298 BCE.Chandragupta Maurya was an important figure in the history of India
                & He was the first Emperor of India.
                The Maurya kingdom expanded to become an empire that reached its peak under the reign of his grandson,
                Ashoka, from 268 BCE to 231 BCE.</p>

            <p>Chandragupta Maurya was an important figure in the history of India, who laid the foundations of the
                first
                state that united most of India.
                Chandragupta, under the tutelage of Chanakya, created a new empire based on the principles of
                statecraft,
                built a large army, and continued expanding the boundaries of his empire until ultimately renouncing it
                for
                an ascetic life in his final years.</p>

            <p>Prior to his consolidation of power, Alexander the Great had invaded the North-West Indian subcontinent
                before abandoning his campaign in 324 BCE due to a mutiny caused by the prospect of facing another large
                empire, presumably the Nanda Empire.
                Chandragupta defeated and conquered both the Nanda Empire and the Greek satraps that were appointed or
                formed from Alexander's Empire in South Asia. He set out to conquer the Nanda Empire centered in
                Pataliputra, Magadha. </p>

        <h2 style="color: brown;"><u>Influence of Chanakya (Kautilya or Vishnugupta)</u></h2>

        <p>The Buddhist and Hindu sources present different versions of how Chandragupta met Chanakya. Broadly,
            they mention young Chandragupta creating a mock game of a royal court that he and his cowherd friends played
            near Vinjha forest.
            Chanakya saw him give orders to the others, bought him from the hunter, and adopted Chandragupta.
            Chanakya taught and admitted him in Taxila to study the Vedas, military arts, law, and other sastras.</p>
        <p>After Taxila, Chandragupta and Chanakya moved to Pataliputra, the capital and a historic learning center in
            the
            eastern Magadha kingdom of India.
            They met Nanda there according to Hindu sources, and Dhana Nanda according to Pali-language Buddhist
            sources.Chandragupta became a commander of the Nanda army, but according to Justin, Chandragupta offended
            the
            Nanda king ("Nandrum" or "Nandrus") who ordered his execution.An alternative version states that it was the
            Nanda king who was publicly insulted by Chanakya.
            Chandragupta and Chanakya escaped and became rebels who planned to remove the Nanda king from power.
            The Mudrarakshasa also states that Chanakya swore to destroy the Nanda dynasty after he felt insulted by the
            king.</p>

        <h2 style="color: brown;"><u>Empire</u></h2>
        <p>
            There are no records of Chandragupta's military conquests and the reach of his empire. It is based on
            inferences from Greek and Roman historians and the religious Indian texts written centuries after his death.
            Based on these, the North-West reach of his empire included parts of present-day Afghanistan that Seleucus I
            Nicator ceded to him including Kabul, Kandahar, Taxila and Gandhara.
            These are the areas where his grandson Ashoka left the major Kandahar rock edict and other edicts in the
            Greek and Aramaic languages.</p>

        <p>In the west, Chandragupta's rule over present-day Gujarat is attested to by Ashoka's inscription in Junagadh.
            On the same rock, about 400 years later, Rudradaman inscribed a longer text sometime about the mid
            second-century.
            Rudradaman's inscription states that the Sudarshana lake in the area was commissioned during the rule of
            Chandragupta through his governor Vaishya Pushyagupta and conduits were added during Ashoka's rule through
            Tushaspha.
            The Mauryan control of the region is further corroborated by the inscription on the rock, which suggests
            that Chandragupta controlled the Malwa region in Central India, located between Gujarat and Pataliputra.</p>

        <h2 style="color: brown;"><u>Rule</u></h2>
        <p>
            The empire was organised into territories (janapada), centres of regional power were protected with forts
            (durga), and state operations were funded with treasury (kosa).[111] Strabo, in his Geographica composed
            about 300 years after Chandragupta's death, describes aspects of his rule in his chapter XV.46â€“69. He had
            councillors for matters of justice and assessors to collect taxes on commercial activity and trade goods. He
            routinely performed Vedic sacrifices,[112] Brahmanical rituals,
            [failed verification] and hosted major festivals marked by procession of elephants and horses.
            His officers inspected situations requiring law and order in the cities; the crime rate was low.</p>
